== Software to Install
* brew install --cask unnaturalscrollwheels
* brew install --cask yippy
* brew install --cask rectangle

== Configuration
Home and End keys are not working properly. Here is what I did to fix (possibly both is needed!):
1. Identify USB Keyboard type (for instance, ANSI for US-type keyboard with backslash over return key).
1. Redefined KeyBindings in `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict` (see the file in this folder)
