# TEST RIDES

## Honda Africa Twin CRF1100L
The salesman said most of the bikes they sell with DCT (automatic gears).

- feels nice to ride
- pleasant suspension
- great for travel
<div class="bad">

- lacks emotion
- not that much power for a heavy adv bike
</div>

## Yamaha Tenere 700

- back to basics: no riding modes, electronics, ...
- fun to ride

<div class="bad">

- bad for travelling especially with a passenger
</div>

## Husquarna Norden 901

- mid size with enough power
<div class="bad">

- quickshifter not always working as expected
- too indistinguishable from the 890
- optics
</div>

## KTM Adventure 890R

- (probably) great offroad
<div class="bad">

- did not blow me away
</div>

## KTM Super Adventure 1290R

- lot of power
  
<div class="bad">

- it has so much torque it doesn't even need to be revved
- feels heavy
</div>

## Ducati DesertX

Contact: Dirk. He said that DesertX has desmo and that Multistradas are not really meant for offroading.

- nice on curvy roads
- appears to be good for offroad
<div class="bad">

- lot of buffeting at higher speeds (from 100 km/h)
- unpleasant grunting sound
